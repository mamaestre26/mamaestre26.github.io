<H2>Why Does Tyler, the Creator Stand Out?</H2>


<p>Any fan of Tyler, the Creator, would know that he goes through many eras of fashion and style, typically before releasing 
a new album. This will hint towards the genre and theme of the new release. For example, in 2019, he released an album called 
“IGOR,” which completely surprised his audience because it had elements of hip-hop, R&B, and rock. These elements were surprising 
because his previous two albums consisted heavily of jazz. This allowed him not only to broaden his target audience but also to 
demonstrate to everyone that he is capable of doing something different than what he is used to. </p>
